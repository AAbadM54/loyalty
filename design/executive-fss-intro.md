Financial services businesses are now able to safely build sensitive and confidential data, and critical business applications, on the public cloud with the introduction of [the Worldâ€™s First FSS Ready Public Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-fss-ready-public-cloud-uncompromising-security-and-compliance) from IBM.

**This pioneering platform brings on demand public cloud flexibility to financal segment developers so they can confidently and securely modernize, architect, and create apps with virtual machines, containers, microservices, along with a catalog of reliable services.**

Industry is entering a point of inflection, where the need for creating secure apps on public clouds is urgently becoming necessary. 

Recently, many businesses forced to accelerate their adoption of cloud technology because their employees are working from home. Without the cloud, many businesses would have found some operations more challenging at this time.

The new Financial Services Ready Public Cloud introduces the IBM Cloud Policy Framework - a necessary streamlined approach to reliably and efficiently create compliance regulated apps. IBM Cloud has worked with Bank of America to establish a collaborative platform that financial apps can follow a controlled approach to be built on.

Building on IBM's strong history within the financial industry, the FSS Ready Cloud is growing momentum with a trusted financial ecosystem including BNP Paribas and with ISVs and partners like VMWare. This ecosystem is refining the approach and strengthening the platform with each publicly hosted offering.
